In short, it's CurseForge for DOOM. A full mod manager utilizing various tools. It will allow modpack creation, and allow you to easily click from a library of mods, and add them to the pack, or or to pick a pack from a ModPack library.

This project is a WIP. - As of now is not published yet.
If you wish to support the project, the project can be funded with ~VENMO~
Venmo cannot be used by people outside the US. If you do not have Venmo/are outside the US, you can support the project via word of mouth. An alternative to Venmo will come soon.

- $5 or more = early access

Early access members are verified with a special key in a Database.
When the Venmo and/or alternative is made accessible, a setup will be made so that when you pay, you can add a contact info. You will be contacted with a special key, (random string of characters) - Which will be in a file format. The file will have no extension and no content, the name of the file will be the key. You can copy/paste the key by renaming the file and copying the name when highlighted. Do NOT let ANYONE see this key. It's recommended you put it in some kind of locked cloud storage, and delete it locally from your computer. Or, hide it in a Zip file on your computer so you dont accidentally show someone if screen-sharing something, this works for people who have computers with passcodes to open the computer, and is secure on computer, -IF- the computer is not used / accessed by other people, and is soley your computer.
